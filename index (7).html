          <h2>  (The historical story )</h2><br> Until the time of the Huxus, where there was a belief among the Egyptians that the plant that grows on the banks of the Nile and its name "khaya" is a poisonous plant, so they were afraid of it and did not approach it.

Until the Hycous entered Egypt and deliberately humiliated and insulted the Egyptians and forced them to eat this plant called "Khaya" and they told them to eat Kolokhaya, but when the Egyptians forcedly ate it, they found its taste beautiful and non-toxic contrary to what they thought, which started the legend of Mukhokhiya in the life of the Egyptians,
 caused the religion of God a severe pain in the stomach, so the doctors advised him to eat the Mallow, and indeed he was cured after eating it, so he forbade it for the people to be affected by eating it for himself and his entourage, so that he called it "king" that is, it is the food of kings, and with time it was twisted to Mallow, and after the end of the rule of Al-Mu'izz  bi deen allah Al fatimy and the end of the entire Fatimid state, the Mukhiyah became a great place for the Egyptians who cook it on their favorite holidays and occasions and on ordinary days as well.<br><h2>(Nutrients):<h2> contains: calcium, protein ,iron <br><h2>(Ingredients):</h2><br><br>

 <h1>2-kushary:</h1><br> <br> <img src= "C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\Programs\htdocs\website 222\9659875de2bbc14a6e184501302b2a24.jpg"/> <br> <h2>( The historical story)</h2><br> Kushary is a food that is linked to the Egyptian personality
 But the Koshari is not of Egyptian origin, so the origin of Kushri food dates back to the First World War when the Indians came with the British forces when they imposed British protection on Egypt in 1914, and they called it "Kushri" at the time, and because the Egyptian is "social", it was always mixed with Indian soldiers and the Koshari food moved to Egyptian cuisine.

The dish spread in various Egyptian neighbourhoods until it reached a neighbourhood that was inhabited by some Italian minorities, so they added pasta to Kushria, but Egyptians are credited with adding precision with vinegar and tom to it, and since then the Kushary has become one of the basics of the Egyptian table.<br><h2>(Nutrients):</h2><br><br> contains:protein ,carbohydrates, fibres<br> <br><h2>(Ingredients):</h2><br> <br>2 cups of brown lentils.<br>

<h1>3-Om Ali:</h1>   <br>  <br>   <img src="C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\Programs\htdocs\website 222\0da55c202deab7cc8d14e49185a69dbf.jpg"/> <br> <h2>(The historical story)</h2><br>omm Ali is the second wife of King Izz al-Din Aybak, whom Shajar al-Durr married to be the king of the country ostensibly because of the people’s refusal to have a woman take over the reins. She continued to run the country under the cover of Izz al-Din Aybak until she killed him, and here his second wife, the mother of his child, Ali, appeared to take the reins. In revenge, her husband and the father of her child plotted to kill her and beat her violently with sandals until she was killed. On the occasion of the killing of Shajar al-Durr, “omm Ali” made a meal of flour, sugar, ghee, and chips and distributed it to everyone to celebrate the death of Shajar al-Durr, and from here they called her “omm Ali’s” dish.<br><h2> (Ingredients)</h2>:<br><br>/2 kilogram of puff pastry dough<br>
